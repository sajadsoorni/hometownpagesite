            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>
              Sanandaj, historically known as Sena, has a history dating back
              several centuries. It was officially founded in the 17th century
              during the Safavid dynasty, although the region itself has been
              inhabited for much longer. The city's historical importance has
              made it a focal point in Kurdish history and culture. Throughout
              the centuries, it has been shaped by various rulers and dynasties,
              from the Safavids to the Qajars, leaving a lasting influence on
              its architecture, culture, and society.

            <h1>Music and Dance</h1>
            <p>
              Music is a fundamental part of life in Sanandaj. The city has
              produced many renowned Kurdish musicians, and traditional Kurdish
              music, with its emotional and storytelling elements, remains
              popular. Instruments like the daf (a large frame drum) and tanbur
              (a type of lute) are widely used in Kurdish music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kurdish dance, particularly the Halparke, is performed during
              celebrations and festivals. These dances are typically performed
              in groups, with dancers holding hands and moving in a circle or
              line. The dances are expressive, rhythmic, and deeply connected to
              the communal spirit of Kurdish culture.
