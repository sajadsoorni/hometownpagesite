              <h1>History</h1>
              <p>
                Sanandaj, historically known as Sena, has a history dating back
                several centuries. It was officially founded in the 17th century
                during the Safavid dynasty, although the region itself has been
                inhabited for much longer. The city's historical importance has
                made it a focal point in Kurdish history and culture. Throughout
                the centuries, it has been shaped by various rulers and
                dynasties, from the Safavids to the Qajars, leaving a lasting
                influence on its architecture, culture, and society.

              <p>
                Sanandaj is a hub of Kurdish culture, traditions, and language.
                The city is deeply rooted in Kurdish customs, and the majority
                of the population identifies as Kurdish. The traditional Kurdish
                lifestyle, with its emphasis on community, art, and
                storytelling, is prevalent in the city. Sanandaj also has
                historic architecture, including traditional bazaars, mosques,
                and old houses that reflect its cultural significance.

              <h1>Music and Dance</h1>
              <p>
                Music is a fundamental part of life in Sanandaj. The city has
                produced many renowned Kurdish musicians, and traditional
                Kurdish music, with its emotional and storytelling elements,
                remains popular. Instruments like the daf (a large frame drum)
                and tanbur (a type of lute) are widely used in Kurdish music.
                Kurdish dance, particularly the Halparke, is performed during
                celebrations and festivals. These dances are typically performed
                in groups, with dancers holding hands and moving in a circle or
                line. The dances are expressive, rhythmic, and deeply connected
                to the communal spirit of Kurdish culture.
